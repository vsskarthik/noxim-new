Usage: ./hotspot_ttable dim_x dim_y pairs_prob src dst pir

Where:
	"dim_x" and "dim_y" are the dimensions of the mesh taken into account;
	"pairs_prob" is the probability for each pair of nodes from "src" and "dst" regions to communicate;
	"src" and "dst" are rectangular regions specified by top left corner and bottom right corners;
	"pir" or packet injection rate, may be a specific value or a range (two values).

Example:
./hotspot_ttable 8 8 0.5 0 18 52 63 0.001
./hotspot_ttable 8 8 0.5 0 18 52 63 0.001 0.005
